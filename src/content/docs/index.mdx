  <TabItem label="Overview">
    The **Abyssinian** is one of the oldest established domestic cat breeds. Genetic studies published
    in *Genomics* (Lipinski et al., 2008, UC Davis) place its origins in Southeast Asia and the coastal
    Indian Ocean. First exhibited in England after specimens were brought from Abyssinia (present-day
    Ethiopia) in 1868, the breed was formally recognized in 1929 by the GCCF. By 2016 it had climbed
    into the top five most popular breeds in the United States.

    The Abyssinian is lithe, fine-boned, and muscular, with a distinctive "ticked" tabby coat produced
    by the agouti gene — individual hairs carry three or four alternating colour bands, creating a warm,
    shimmering, wild-cat appearance. Personality-wise, Abys are dog-like in their curiosity and loyalty:
    they follow owners room-to-room, encourage play, and are rarely at rest.

  <TabItem label="Pros & Cons">
    <div class="pros-cons">
      <div class="pros-cons-col">
        #### ✅ Strengths
        <ul>
          <li>Highly intelligent and trainable — picks up tricks, leash walking, and fetch rapidly</li>
          <li>Low-maintenance short coat; minimal shedding and almost no brushing required</li>
          <li>Stunning, unique ticked coat with a wild-cat aesthetic unlike any other domestic breed</li>
          <li>Highly social; thrives in multi-cat households</li>
          <li>Readily available — widespread reputable breeders</li>
          <li>Active and energetic; excellent companion for a dynamic household</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="pros-cons-col">
        #### ❌ Weaknesses
        <ul>
          <li>Definitively **not** a lap cat — in near-constant motion</li>
          <li>Demanding of attention; destructive if understimulated</li>
          <li>Poor tolerance of solitude; prone to stress-related anxiety and alopecia when alone</li>
          <li>Significant hereditary health risks requiring genetic screening (PRA, PK Deficiency)</li>
          <li>Can be reserved and shy with unfamiliar people despite high energy with family</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Health">
    <Aside type="caution" title="Genetic Testing is Essential">
      Several of the following conditions have documented genetic bases in the Abyssinian.
      Always request PRA and PK Deficiency DNA test results from breeders before purchase.
    </Aside>

    | Condition | Notes |
    |---|---|
    | **Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)** | Most-affected breed; two mutations: *CRX* gene (early-onset, dominant) and *CEP290* gene (late-onset, recessive). DNA tests commercially available. (Menotti-Raymond et al., 2010) |
    | **Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Deficiency** | Hereditary haemolytic anaemia; autosomal recessive. PK-test screening of all breeding pairs is strongly recommended. |
    | **Aortic Thromboembolism (ATE)** | Odds ratio of 6.03 vs. general cat population (Smith et al., *J Vet Intern Med*, 2003) |
    | **Renal Amyloidosis** | Reported in some family lines; causes progressive kidney failure |
    | **Feline Atopic Dermatitis / Psychogenic Alopecia** | Over-represented in dermatology referral caseloads |
    | **Acquired Myasthenia Gravis** | Documented predisposition; odds ratio of 4.97 vs. general population |
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Diet & Care">
    - **High-protein, animal-based diet** — minimum 30–40% protein on a dry-matter basis. Chicken,
      turkey, or fish as the primary ingredient.
    - **Include wet food** to maintain hydration and reduce the risk of lower urinary tract disease.
    - **Portion control** is important despite their high activity level — they can over-eat freely.
    - **Taurine** must be present in the diet; any AAFCO-complete commercial cat food satisfies this.
    - No exotic breed-specific supplementation required beyond a quality complete diet.
    - **Grooming:** Occasional light brushing (once weekly). Rarely needs bathing.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Play & Emotional Needs">
    **Emotional Needs**

    - Requires consistent daily human interaction; a companion cat is strongly recommended for owners
      who work long hours
    - Environmental enrichment is essential — wall-mounted shelves, tall cat trees, window perches,
      rotating puzzle feeders
    - Becomes stressed in small, unstimulating spaces; may redirect anxiety into over-grooming or
      vocalization
    - Positive-reinforcement training sessions double as meaningful cognitive enrichment

    **Playtime: 30–45 min/day (multiple sessions)**

    - Interactive wand toys, puzzle feeders, feather teasers, and fetch with lightweight balls
    - Laser pointers work well — always end laser sessions with a tangible toy to "catch"
    - Benefits from outdoor cat enclosures or leash walks if securely managed
    - Rotate toys regularly; the Abyssinian is highly motivated by novelty

  <TabItem label="Overview">
    The **Toyger** is a fully domestic cat with absolutely no wild tiger genetics. Developed from the
    1980s onward by breeder Judy Sugden (daughter of Bengal breed creator Jean Mill), its foundation
    stock included a striped domestic shorthair named Scrapmetal, a Bengal named Millwood Rumpled
    Spotskin, and a Kashmiri street cat named Jammu Blu. TICA granted full championship status in
    February 2007.

    As of 2024, roughly 30 active Toyger breeders are listed globally, making this a genuinely rare
    breed. The Toyger was founded in part to raise public awareness of endangered wild tigers — a
    meaningful conservation story embedded in the breed's origin.

          <li>Extreme rarity — ~30 breeders worldwide; significant waiting lists and high cost</li>
          <li>Prone to separation anxiety when left alone frequently; companion pet advisable</li>
          <li>Emerging breed with limited long-term epidemiological health data</li>

        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Health">
    <Aside type="caution" title="Young Breed — Limited Data">
      Because the Toyger is a young breed, long-term epidemiological studies are limited.
      Owners should maintain annual cardiac monitoring and work with breeders who conduct
      active health screening.
    </Aside>

    | Condition | Notes |
    |---|---|
    | **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)** | Primary health concern; inherited from Bengal ancestry. Responsible breeders conduct echocardiographic screening of all breeding cats. Annual cardiac monitoring recommended for owned Toygers. |
    | **Cataracts** | Elevated risk vs. general cat population; documented in veterinary literature |
    | **Holoprosencephaly** | Rare neurological developmental defect linked to *GDF7* gene deletion; associated with breeding for short ears. Ethical breeders avoid this selection trait. |
    | **Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)** | Some risk inherited from Bengal ancestry; DNA testing available |
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Diet & Care">
    - **High-quality, high-protein diet** meeting AAFCO or FEDIAF complete-and-balanced standards.
      Real meat or fish as the primary ingredient.
    - **Combination of wet and dry food** — wet for hydration, dry for dental benefit.
    - **Portion-controlled meals twice daily** (not free-fed); excess weight stresses joints in this
      medium-to-large, active breed.
    - Fresh water available at all times — active cats with higher muscle mass have elevated hydration
      needs.
    - No breed-specific supplementation required beyond a quality complete diet.
    - **Grooming:** Short, dense coat — weekly light brushing is sufficient.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Play & Emotional Needs">
    **Emotional Needs**

    - Craves consistent companionship; bonds deeply with the entire family unit
    - Not suited to being left alone all day without a feline or canine companion
    - Calm, quiet home environments preferred — unpredictable noise and chaos causes stress
    - Responds to positive, engaged attention; temperament can turn withdrawn if consistently ignored

    **Playtime: 20–30 min/day (structured sessions)**

    - Highly trainable for leash walks, fetch, agility, and exercise wheels (many Toygers use
      exercise wheels spontaneously, per TICA)
    - Puzzle feeders engage their intelligence and slow eating
    - Cat trees and elevated perches allow natural observation behavior
    - Interactive wand toys and teaser toys satisfy hunting instincts

## 3. Suphalak

<Aside type="caution" title="Availability Warning">
  The Suphalak is among the rarest cat breeds on the planet. As of writing, meaningful
  populations exist only in Thailand, with a tiny breeding group in the United States.
  The first Suphalak born outside Thailand was a female born in the US on September 15, 2015.

  <TabItem label="Overview">
    The **Suphalak** (Thai: ศุภลักษณ์), also known as *Thong Daeng* (copper), is an ancient natural
    breed described in the *Tamra Maew* — Thai cat poems from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351–1767 AD)
    that compare the rarity of a true Suphalak to gold. It is genetically a chocolate self-coloured
    cat, requiring two recessive brown alleles (*b/b*) combined with dominant full-colour — a genetic
    combination that arises with extraordinary rarity.

    The Suphalak is often confused with the sable Burmese or the Havana Brown, but differs
    fundamentally: a true Suphalak has a wholly solid copper-brown coat extending uniformly to the skin,
    with no dark points on face, ears, or extremities whatsoever.

    <Aside type="tip" title="Naturally Healthy — But Watch for Behavioral Health">
      The Suphalak, as a natural breed with limited commercial crossbreeding, does not carry the
      concentrated hereditary disease burdens seen in many engineered breeds. However, the population
      is so small that comprehensive epidemiological data does not yet exist. The most documented
      health risk is behavioral: separation anxiety.
    </Aside>

    | Condition | Notes |
    |---|---|
    | **No documented breed-specific hereditary diseases** | As of current literature (Hepper Pet Resources, 2025; catbreedselector.com). Owners should monitor TIMBA and veterinary breed research as the population grows. |
    | **Separation Anxiety** | A significant documented behavioral health concern in this deeply people-bonded breed |
    | **General domestic cat risks** | Dental disease, obesity (if inactive), parasites, respiratory infections — manage via regular biannual veterinary check-ups |
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Diet & Care">
    - **High-protein, obligate carnivore diet** — animal meat (chicken, turkey, fish) as the primary
      ingredient in any AAFCO-complete commercial food.
    - **Higher caloric intake** may be required compared to less active breeds, given elevated energy
      levels (The Vet Desk, 2025).
    - **Wet and dry food combination** to maintain hydration and kidney function.
    - **Fresh water at all times** — critical for active cats with higher metabolic rates.
    - No exotic breed-specific diet is required beyond a quality complete commercial food.
    - **Grooming:** Twice-weekly brushing; short silky coat is easy to maintain.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Play & Emotional Needs">
    **Emotional Needs**

    - A deep human bond is essential — not suited to inattentive or frequently absent owners
    - Should not be left alone all day without a feline companion or active enrichment program
    - Thrives on consistent daily interaction: conversation, play, and physical contact
    - Requires calm, loving household — punitive handling causes lasting anxiety
    - Positive reinforcement and approval-based training doubles as valuable bonding time

    **Playtime: 20–30 min/day (structured)**

    - Cat trees, climbing walls, and ample floor space for running are essential
    - Interactive toys (wand toys, puzzle feeders, teaser toys) that engage their intelligence
    - Can learn fetch and recall-based games; integrate training into play sessions
    - Enrichment is not optional — an unstimulated Suphalak becomes an anxious Suphalak

  <TabItem label="Overview">
    The **Cornish Rex** arose from a natural spontaneous mutation in a litter born on a farm in
    Bodmin Moor, Cornwall on July 21, 1950. The founding kitten, Kallibunker, had a crimped, soft,
    curly coat caused by a recessive mutation in the *KRT71* gene. Unlike the Devon Rex's structurally
    different mutation, the Cornish Rex coat consists **only** of the fine, soft down undercoat —
    the guard hairs and awn hairs are entirely absent — producing a coat often described as feeling
    like warm crushed velvet or suede.

    The breed is now well-established globally and recognized by all major registries. It is
    frequently (and incorrectly) marketed as hypoallergenic — the Cornish Rex produces the same
    Fel d 1 protein as other cats; only the reduced shedding may lessen, but never eliminate, exposure.

          <li>Uniquely soft coat — often described as crushed velvet or warm suede; minimal shedding</li>
          <li>Highly affectionate and people-oriented; seeks physical contact and lap time actively</li>
          <li>Kitten-like energy and playfulness that persists well into senior years</li>
          <li>Extremely low coat maintenance — no brushing required</li>
          <li>Adapts well to indoor apartment life with adequate enrichment</li>
          <li>Trainable and intelligent — fetch, clicker training, leash walking all achievable</li>

      <div class="pros-cons-col">
        #### ❌ Weaknesses
        <ul>
          <li>Temperature sensitive — obsessively seeks heat; not suited to cold homes or climates</li>
          <li>Not hypoallergenic despite common claims — same Fel d 1 allergen as all domestic cats</li>
          <li>Can develop greasy skin as sebum accumulates without guard hairs to wick it; occasional bathing required</li>
          <li>Sensitive skin — more susceptible to sunburn and abrasion</li>
          <li>Demanding of attention; becomes unhappy and develops behavioral issues if consistently ignored</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Health">
    <Aside type="caution" title="Anesthesia Sensitivity">
      Inform your veterinarian that your cat is a Cornish Rex before any procedure requiring
      general anesthesia. Some reports suggest this breed may respond more sensitively to
      certain anesthetic agents.
    </Aside>

    | Condition | Notes |
    |---|---|
    | **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)** | Most common cardiac disease in domestic cats; elevated breed predisposition in Cornish Rex. Echocardiographic screening of breeding cats strongly advised. |
    | **Hereditary Myopathy** | Rare autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy variant documented in some Cornish Rex lines; causes progressive muscle weakness |
    | **Skin / Coat Issues** | Seborrhoea oleosa (oily skin) and UV radiation sensitivity due to absent guard hairs |
    | **Dental / Periodontal Disease** | Common across breeds; dental hygiene from kittenhood is recommended |
    | **Patellar Luxation** | Reported in some lines |
    | **Anesthesia Sensitivity** | Inform veterinarians of breed prior to any procedure |
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Diet & Care">
    - **Higher caloric intake per pound** may be required — without guard hairs, the Cornish Rex
      loses body heat faster and may burn slightly more calories maintaining core temperature.
    - **High-quality protein-rich diet** — real meat or fish as primary ingredient.
    - **Wet food inclusion** supports hydration and reduces urinary tract disease risk.
    - **Portion-controlled meals** — despite high activity, free-feeding can lead to obesity.
    - **Taurine, arachidonic acid, and vitamin A** must be present (met by any AAFCO-complete food).
    - **Grooming:** No brushing required. Occasional gentle wipe-down or hand-groom. Bathe
      periodically (every few weeks) to prevent sebum build-up on skin.
    - **Keep warm** — heated beds, fleece blankets, and radiator perches are genuinely important
      for this breed's comfort and wellbeing.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Play & Emotional Needs">
    **Emotional Needs**

    - Craves warmth both physically (heat sources, your lap) and emotionally (attention, play,
      conversation)
    - Not suited to solitary living — does best with consistent human companionship or a cat companion
    - Highly tactile; thrives on stroking, grooming, and physical closeness
    - Responds to its name and seeks eye contact — treat it as a companion, not furniture
    - Intelligent enough to develop behavioral problems (vocalization, clinginess, minor destructiveness)
      when emotionally neglected

    **Playtime: 30 min/day (spread across sessions)**

    - Retains kitten-like play behaviors into senior years — never assume a 10-year-old Cornish Rex
      has outgrown the need for play
    - Highly motivated by interactive wand toys, feather teasers, and fetch with lightweight balls
    - Puzzle feeders engage intelligence and help manage eating pace
    - Warm, padded cat trees and heated perches satisfy both play and thermoregulation needs

  <TabItem label="Overview">
    The **Somali** is the semi-longhaired variant of the Abyssinian, produced by a naturally occurring
    recessive longhair gene (*M/l* allele) that had been present but suppressed in Abyssinian breeding
    stock for decades. Selectively bred from the 1960s and 1970s by breeders including Evelyn Mague
    (US) and Janet Robertson (Canada), the Somali is now fully recognized by all major registries.

    The **ruddy** colourway — a warm reddish-brown base coat with black ticking, a black tail tip,
    and dark heels — is the original and most iconic expression. Somalis share nearly all temperament
    traits with the Abyssinian, distinguished primarily by their flowing coat, full brush tail, ear
    tufts, ruff, and a somewhat longer documented lifespan range.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Health">
    <Aside type="caution" title="Shares Abyssinian Hereditary Risks">
      As a genetic derivative of the Abyssinian, the Somali carries the same PRA and PK Deficiency
      predispositions. Request DNA test results from breeders and budget for annual veterinary
      dental prophylaxis.
    </Aside>

    | Condition | Notes |
    |---|---|
    | **Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)** | Shares Abyssinian susceptibility via *CRX* (early-onset, dominant) and *CEP290* (late-onset, recessive) mutations. DNA testing of breeding cats available and strongly recommended. (Menotti-Raymond et al., 2010) |
    | **Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Deficiency** | Hereditary haemolytic anaemia from recessive *PKLR* gene mutation. Commercially available DNA test; responsible breeders screen all breeding stock. |
    | **Renal Amyloidosis** | Documented in some Somali lines; causes progressive chronic kidney disease |
    | **Feline Atopic Dermatitis** | Reported in Somalis, consistent with Abyssinian predisposition |
    | **Chronic Gingivitis / Stomatitis** | Reported at higher rates in the Abyssinian/Somali group than in the broader cat population; regular dental prophylaxis critical |
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Diet & Care">
    - **High-quality, high-protein diet** — minimum 30–35% protein on dry-matter basis; real poultry,
      fish, or meat as the first ingredient.
    - **Wet food is highly advisable** — Somalis are prone to renal conditions; a moisture-rich diet
      actively supports kidney health.
    - **Omega-3 fatty acids** (e.g., fish oil or salmon-containing foods) support coat quality and
      reduce inflammatory skin conditions — particularly relevant given the dermatitis predisposition.
    - **Healthy weight maintenance** — excess body weight compounds stress on kidneys and joints.
    - **Taurine, arachidonic acid, and vitamin A** must be present (met by any AAFCO-complete food).
    - **Grooming:** 2–3 brushings per week with a stainless steel comb and soft slicker brush. The
      coat is single-layered and less prone to matting than some longhaired breeds, but the ruff and
      flanks are tangle-prone. Seasonal shedding periods may require daily brushing.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Play & Emotional Needs">
    **Emotional Needs**

    - Highly social and emotionally engaged — consistent human presence and interaction is essential
    - A companion cat is strongly recommended for owners who work outside the home
    - Sensitive to environmental stress — major changes (new homes, loud noise, prolonged isolation)
      can manifest as over-grooming or appetite changes
    - Not the cat to adopt if you want minimal interaction; thrives on being included in household
      activity
    - Though not classic lap cats, Somalis develop strong proximity bonds — your shadow with better fur

    **Playtime: 30–45 min/day (two sessions recommended)**

    - Highly motivated by wand toys, feather teasers, and prey-mimicking erratic fast movements
    - **Vertical enrichment is key** — tall cat trees, wall-mounted shelves, and window hammocks satisfy
      the Somali's deep exploratory instinct
    - Leash training is feasible and highly recommended as a safe energy outlet
    - Puzzle feeders and snuffle mats extend engagement between active play sessions
    - Long-lived breed — play needs remain significant well into their teenage years; don't scale back
      too early
